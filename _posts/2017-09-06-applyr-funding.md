Amsterdam, 26 June 2017, Artificial Intelligence company Applyr receives seed funding from VentureBuilders Capital Partners, the investment arm of VentureBuilders.

Applyr was co-founded by Stephen Parkins and Rense van der Hoek with the aim to make recruitment more human. For both recruiters and for candidates. With this objective in mind, the Company developed recruiter chatbots who interact with candidates on a company’s careers website. They use the power of AI to radically improve the hiring process.

The funding and expertise of VentureBuilders will be used to increase R&D capacity and facilitate the commercial roll-out of the products.
