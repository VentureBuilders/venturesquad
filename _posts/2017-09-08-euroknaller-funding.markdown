Amsterdam, 8 September 2017, daily deal platform Euroknaller received growth funding from a consortium of investors led by VentureBuilders Capital Partners, the investment arm of VentureBuilders.

Euroknaller offers great products for extraordinary low prices. The Company was co-founded by the founders of the successful daily deal company GroupDeal (sold in 2014 to Telegraaf Media Group) and aims to increase retention by offering a loyalty scheme and gamification component. 

Euroknaller will use the funding and expertise of VentureBuilders to accelerate its growth.
